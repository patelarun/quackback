/**
 * Schema versions, and the compatibility floor a pooled fleet gates on.
 *
 * Under pooled compute one code version serves workspaces on two schema versions
 * for the duration of every rollout (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §10). Expand-only is
 * necessary but **not sufficient**, and the reason is specific: Drizzle emits
 * explicit column lists, so a build that postdates an additive migration issues
 * `select "id", …, "cloud", … from "settings"` and `findFirst()` *throws* on a
 * database where that column does not exist yet. A missing value and a missing
 * column are not the same thing.
 *
 * So the rule is an ordering rule: additive change must be applied **before**
 * the code that reads it. `MIN_SCHEMA_VERSION` is where a build states the
 * oldest schema it tolerates, and the workspace middleware refuses a workspace below
 * it — 503 for that workspace only, never for the fleet (§10.5).
 *
 * ## Why the floor is a prefix check and not a high-water mark
 *
 * A ledger is a *set*, not a counter, and this fleet has proved it: five live
 * gauntlet workspace databases have every one of their 226 ledger rows and are
 * physically carrying migrations 0251/0252/0253 that no row records, because
 * they were applied with `psql -f`. A high-water comparison
 * (`max(created_at) >= floor`) would read a database with a gap as satisfied.
 *
 * {@link evaluateSchemaFloor} therefore asks the only question that is
 * actually load-bearing: *is every bundled migration at or below the floor
 * present in this database's ledger?* Extra rows above the floor are ignored,
 * which is deliberate and is the second half of §10.2's instruction to keep
 * `getMigrationStatus()`'s semantics: **a workspace ahead of the code must keep
 * being served by the code it is ahead of**, because that is precisely what
 * happens to every not-yet-restarted replica during a rollout.

 * preflight must not do. A *caller-relative* path breaks that, because the
 * answer then depends on where the process was started, which is why the
 * fallback is resolved from `import.meta.url`.
 *
 * `MIGRATIONS_FOLDER` does not break it, and is needed. Bundling collapses
 * every module into one file, so `import.meta.url` becomes the bundle's own
 * path and `../drizzle` lands a directory above the SQL — which is exactly the
 * shape the image ships: `/app/fleet-migrator.mjs` beside `/app/drizzle`. The
 * variable is deployment-level and read once here, so both halves still resolve
 * to the same directory; it is also the variable `migrate.ts` has always
 * honoured, so the image's existing `MIGRATIONS_FOLDER=/app/drizzle` already
