 * before any conversation exists — and the durable home the visitor-analytics
 * device map converges toward.
 *
 * No TypeID primary key: the natural key IS the identity, so the composite PK
 * (channel, external_id) is both the row identity and the uniqueness guarantee
 * (one principal per address per channel). `verified` records whether the
 * association was cryptographically proven (a verified identify) or merely
 * observed (we sent mail to it). The principal_id FK CASCADEs, and the
 * anonymous-to-identified merge re-points it (see principal-repoint.ts).

/**
 * Outbound conversation-email threading map: the Message-ID each notification
 * email went out with, keyed back to its conversation. Two jobs: building the
 * RFC 5322 References chain on the next outbound mail, and routing an inbound
 * reply whose client stripped the plus-address but preserved the
 * In-Reply-To/References headers (the Message-ID fallback). CASCADEs with the
 * conversation.
 *
 * `message_id` is the RFC822 id without its angle brackets, lower-cased for a
 * stable match, in the form the SENDING SIDE reported it. That is two shapes:
 * `local@host` where we chose the id, and `local` alone where the transport
 * chose it and reports it bare. A row is therefore not always a literal token a
 * reply will quote, so match through `resolveConversationByMessageIds` rather
 * than comparing this column to a header value directly. A provider's own
 * delivery events use the bare form and join straight onto it.
