/**
 * The Message-ID vocabulary of the one sending provider that assigns its own.
 *
 * SES generates the `Message-ID` header itself and replaces any we supply. Its
 * API then answers with that id BARE — no host — while the header it signs
 * carries the id at a regional host. Two sides of the system have to agree
 * about that host: the transport, which completes a threading token with it,
 * and the store, which recognises it on a quoted id coming back.
 *
 * Both live here rather than one in each package, because they are two views of
 * one fact and nothing else would hold them together. Apart, they drift apart
 * silently: the side that writes a host and the side that recognises one simply
 * stop agreeing, and the only symptom is a reply that does not route home.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free, so the app's store can import it without
 * dragging a cloud SDK into its module graph.

 * `evil.amazonses.com.attacker.test` are accepted. Without the leading `^`,
 * `evilamazonses.com` is. Neither is the provider, and both are for sale.
 *
 * Subdomain depth is left open rather than pinned at the one label observed so
 * far, because a host form we have not seen must not silently stop being
 * recognised. Depth is not what the anchors are protecting.
