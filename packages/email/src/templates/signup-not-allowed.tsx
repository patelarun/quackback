 * Why no sign-in link arrived.
 *
 * The workspace refuses to open an account for this address, and the HTTP
 * response deliberately does not say so: an endpoint that answered differently
 * per address would tell any unauthenticated caller which addresses hold
 * accounts here. The inbox is the one channel that reaches only the person the
 * answer is about, so the refusal is delivered here instead.
 *
 * Carries no link and no code. There is nothing to grant, which is the point:
 * a message with no capability in it can be mailed to an address nobody has
 * proven they own.
