/**
 * Amazon SES v2 identity provisioning: the calls that make a domain SENDABLE,
 * as opposed to the one call that sends.
 *
 * SES verifies a domain from records its owner publishes rather than from a zone
 * the provider hosts, which is the entire reason a customer can send as their
 * own domain here. Three things have to happen for that: an identity exists,
 * Easy DKIM has issued the three CNAME tokens the owner publishes, and a custom
 * MAIL FROM subdomain is attached so the envelope sender — and therefore SPF —
 * sits on the customer's domain rather than the provider's.
 *
 * ## A second credential, deliberately
 *
 * The sending credential is scoped to `SendEmail` and nothing else. These calls
 * need more, and the extra permission is not the kind a send path should carry
 * around: a process that can create identities can exhaust an account-wide
 * quota, and one that can DELETE them can silently stop every other workspace's
 * mail. So this module reads its own pair of variables and refuses out loud when
 * they are absent, rather than reaching for the sending credential and producing
 * an opaque `AccessDenied` from AWS at a moment nobody is watching.
 *
 * There is no delete here at all, and that is not an omission. Nothing in this
 * module imports `DeleteEmailIdentityCommand`, so removing a domain in the
 * product removes OUR row and leaves the identity for an operator to reap
 * deliberately. The blast radius of a wrong delete is every workspace, and the
 * cost of leaving one behind is a line in a console.
 *
 * ## Region
 *
 * An identity belongs to one region, and it has to be the region the sending
 * client is pointed at, or every send is rejected for an identity that exists
 * somewhere else. Both halves read {@link sesRegion}, so there is one answer to
 * that question rather than two.

/**
 * Attach a custom MAIL FROM subdomain to an identity.
 *
 * ## Why this is not optional
 *
 * Without it the envelope sender is the provider's own domain, so SPF passes
 * for the PROVIDER and aligns with nothing the customer owns. DMARC then rests
 * on DKIM alone, and DKIM alone is exactly the arrangement that fails the moment
 * a hop rewrites a body. Aligned SPF is the second leg, and this call is the
 * only way to get one on a domain the provider does not host.
 *
 * ## Why the failure behaviour is a fallback and not a refusal
 *
 * SES offers two behaviours when the MAIL FROM MX record cannot be found, and
 * the choice is between two different outages. `REJECT_MESSAGE` stops the mail:
 * a customer who reorganises their DNS a year from now loses every outbound
 * support reply until someone notices. `USE_DEFAULT_VALUE` sends anyway with the
 * provider's domain as the envelope sender, which costs SPF ALIGNMENT and keeps
 * delivery — and DKIM, which is aligned and signed with the customer's own keys,
 * still carries DMARC on its own for directly delivered mail.
 *
 * So the strictness is spent where it is cheap and the leniency where it is
 * expensive: a domain is not marked verified here until the MX record is
 * actually found, and once verified a later regression degrades alignment
 * instead of destroying deliverability.
 *
 * That trade only holds if something notices the regression, which a button a
 * person clicks does not. The `sending-domain-recheck` queue is what makes the
 * claim true: it re-asks both authorities on a schedule and demotes a row whose
 * MAIL FROM, DKIM or ownership record has gone, which drops the workspace back
 * to the platform sender rather than leaving it signing on one leg. Removing
 * that queue turns this paragraph back into a hope.
