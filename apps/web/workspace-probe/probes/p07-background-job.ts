/**
 * P07 — a background job enqueued for alpha executing against bravo's database.
 *
 * Under the pooled design the worker tier is shared: one always-warm
 * `QUACKBACK_ROLE=worker` fleet drains queues for every workspace
 * (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §1, §5 caveat 3). A job carries no request scope, so
 * whatever workspace the worker's `db` resolves to is the workspace the job writes to.
 * There is no second gate — the write succeeds, against the wrong database.
 *
 * The probe drives a real write on each workspace through the REST API, lets the
 * derived background work settle, and then asks a question that needs no
 * knowledge of which queue ran: does anything anywhere in the other workspace's
 * database now reference this one's row?
 *
 * The positive control is what makes a null answer meaningful, and it is keyed
 * on a token minted fresh for THIS RUN. See `mintDriveToken` for why nothing
 * weaker survives contact with a real fleet.

/**
 * A token minted fresh for this run, stamped into the content of the write that
 * drives the background work.
 *
 * This is the guard, and it exists because the version without it reported PASS
 * against a fleet where nothing had happened at all. That probe drove the work
 * by PATCHing the fixture post with the content the post ALREADY HAD. The
 * request was accepted (< 400) and changed nothing: measured on the live fleet,
 * `posts.updated_at` had not moved in two days, and the only `events` and
 * `post_activity` rows referencing either fixture post were the `post.created`
 * rows from when the fixture was provisioned. The positive control — "this
 * workspace's database gained derived rows referencing its post" — was satisfied
 * entirely by those two-day-old rows, and the probe passed while the hazard it
 * exists to detect went completely unexercised.
 *
 * A per-run token closes both halves of that at once:
 *
 *  - It cannot exist unless the write actually happened, so a drive that did
 *    nothing leaves nothing to find. WORK WAS DRIVEN is established, not assumed.
 *  - It is different every run, so a row left by an EARLIER run cannot satisfy
 *    it. The evidence is provably this run's.
 *
 * It is deliberately preferred over requiring the derived row to postdate the
 * write, which was the other candidate. That comparison closes only the second
 * hole, needs a clock both sides agree on (the probe's wall clock against each
 * workspace database's `now()` is exactly the skew-sensitive comparison a probe
 * should not be making), and can still be satisfied by an unrelated concurrent
 * write that merely happens to be newer. Freshness by construction needs no
 * clock at all: the token did not exist before this run, so any row containing
 * it postdates the write by definition.
 *
 * Lowercase alphanumeric, like the canaries, so Postgres full-text tokenisation
 * cannot split it and the scan can match it verbatim.
