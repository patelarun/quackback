 *
 *   db          the control store (pooled) or the single database — the thing
 *               every request needs. Down or slow ⇒ 503.
 *   migrations  single-workspace only: the applied ledger is behind the bundled
 *               one, so this build's queries can hit columns that do not exist
 *               yet ⇒ 503 `behind`. Pooled skips it deliberately (§10.5).
 *   workers     a process that should run workers (`worker` or `all`) but
 *               is not running the job worker ⇒ 503. `web` does not expect it.
 *
