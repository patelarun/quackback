/**
 * The storage proxy cache must be partitioned by workspace.
 *
 * It holds file BYTES keyed by storage key, in process memory. Storage keys are
 * per-bucket and the bucket is the workspace boundary, so one process serving two
 * workspaces shares a key namespace *in its own heap* — and a hit returns the
 * other workspace's file with a 200 and no error. Unlike the `Vary` work this is
 * not an edge-cache concern: it needs no CDN and no misconfiguration, only a
 * key that appears in two buckets, which is exactly what an import or a
 * migration produces.
 *
 * **Two tests, because either alone is insufficient**, and the gap between them
 * is precisely how this shipped unpinned: reverting the call sites to the bare
 * key left the entire 11,710-test suite green.
 *
 *  - The behavioural test proves the key function partitions. It would stay
 *    green if every call site stopped using it.
 *  - The call-site scan proves the function is actually applied at every
 *    `proxyCache` access. It would stay green if the function stopped
 *    partitioning.
