/**
 * The inbox route's list-source seam (UNIFIED-INBOX-SPEC.md §3.1): decides
 * whether the active nav scope reads the merged conversation+ticket endpoint
 * or the legacy conversation-only one, runs whichever query is live, and
 * normalizes the result into one `InboxItemDTO[]` — so the predicate
 * (`usesUnifiedInboxList`) and both param builders live in one place instead
 * of being re-derived at each of the route's loader/body/prefetch call sites.
 * The loader keeps its own `usesUnifiedInboxList` call (server context, no
 * hooks available there), but reads the exact same predicate this hook does.
