/**
 * The workspace's inbound route for mail that arrived at its PLATFORM INBOX —
 * `<mail slug>@<inbound domain>`, the address it has from the moment it exists
 * — materialising that route the first time such a message arrives.
 *
 * ## Why a workspace needs this at all
 *
 * Cold inbound binds a new conversation to the front door it landed on, so
 * without a row there is no conversation to create and the message is dropped
 * with nothing retained. Every workspace that had one had it because a person
 * typed a forwarding address into settings, which is the OPT-IN half of the
 * design; the platform address is the DEFAULT half and nobody types it. A
 * workspace that had received no configuration therefore accepted mail at SMTP,
 * generated no bounce, told the sender nothing, and showed the customer nothing.
 *
 * ## Why the row is written here and not seeded somewhere earlier
 *
 * The two facts it is made of are not knowable where a workspace's other
 * defaults are seeded. The default team, the statuses and the boards are seeded
 * by the SQL migration bundle, which has no environment and so cannot know
 * `EMAIL_INBOUND_DOMAIN`; the mail slug is not in the database at all. That is
 * the same wall the identity-provider backfill hit, and it was answered the same
 * way: in-process, idempotent, where the value can actually be read. Boot is too
 * early for a workspace that did not exist at boot, and a periodic pass is a
 * window during which mail is still lost, so the moment that is neither is the
 * first message itself.
 *
 * ## What makes a write here safe on a path a stranger can reach
 *
 * Not one byte of the row comes from the message. Every column is a constant or
 * a fact about this process, and the message is only allowed to decide WHETHER
 * we look, by having been addressed to the platform inbox — decided from the
 * slug on the workspace scope the front door already established, never off a
 * header the message carries. One row is the most that can exist, enforced by
 * the partial unique index rather than by this function noticing.
 *
 * ## Why the row records no address
 *
 * `address` is the column {@link resolveConversationFrom} reads FIRST and the
 * column `channel_accounts_sending_address_uq` is built over, so writing the
 * platform address into it costs three things and buys none: the row falls under
 * a second unique index (a workspace that had registered that same address as a
 * sending identity could then never gain a front door at all, and the failure is
 * a swallowed conflict rather than an error); a stored address permanently
 * shadows the customer's own verified `support@…` in the From chain; and a value
 * minted once goes stale the day the install's mint domain moves. The address is
 * derived on both sides instead — inbound from the recipient's own label,
 * outbound as the last resort of the From chain — so it is always the address
 * this process would recognise today, and it never outranks configuration.
 *
 * Returns the existing route untouched when there is one, whatever address it
 * names. A workspace that forwards its own inbox in has one front door, not two,
 * and the address it forwards FROM is configuration a person typed. A route that
 * was soft-deleted is not one, and the default comes back on the next message:
 * the platform address is what the workspace HAS rather than something it opted
 * into, so the alternative is a workspace that has silently stopped answering on
 * the address it publishes.
