/**
 * The workflow Action executor (support platform §4.6, Slice 3; Phase C
 * conversational block layer, slice C-1). ONE `applyAction(action, ctx)` runs a
 * single action against a conversation, shared by macros ("a bundle of actions
 * with no trigger") and the workflow engine (a bundle of actions with a trigger +
 * conditions). Keeping the catalogue in one place means a new action is wired
 * once and both surfaces get it.
 *
 * Each action is an independent unit that dispatches to the existing conversation
 * services and returns an ActionResult (a short label of what happened, null
 * label = a deferred no-op; blockMessageId set only for a block-sending action).
 * It THROWS on failure so the caller owns the policy: macros apply best-effort
 * (catch + skip), the engine can fail-fast or continue per its run semantics —
 * this is how the write-once attribute refusal (set-attribute.service.ts) and a
 * failed block send both surface: they throw, the engine's per-action try/catch
 * logs and moves on to the next planned action/edge (the routing decision was
 * already made by the pure walker before any action runs).
 *
 * `set_attribute` writes through the shared domain writer, with provenance
 * derived from the actor by default: a macro runs as the invoking agent (src
 * teammate), the engine's service actor records src workflow. `src` can override
 * that default — the graph walker's collect_data/collect_reply resume path
 * stamps src 'customer' explicitly, since those writes are customer-authored
 * even though they execute under the engine's service actor.
 *
 * Block-sending (`send_block`) posts an assistant-persona message through the
 * SAME write path Quinn's own replies use (conversation.service.ts's
 * appendAssistantReply) — reused, not duplicated — with the resolved rich body
 * (variables interpolated server-side; see workflow-variables.ts +
 * lib/shared/workflows/interpolate.ts) as contentJson and an honest plain-text
 * fallback as content, plus the metadata.block payload the DTO projects.
 * `let_assistant_answer` hands the turn to Quinn via the same out-of-band seam
 * sendVisitorMessage uses for an ordinary customer message
 * (assistant.orchestrator's runAssistantTurnForConversation) — see that case's
 * comment for why it's a dynamic import. `record_csat` writes through
 * conversation.service.ts's recordCsat (amendment 1: latest-wins, not a
 * parallel system) — the engine calls this action with the conversation's
 * VISITOR as the actor (recordCsat requires the caller to BE the visitor),
 * never the run's own service actor.
 *
 * `add_note` posts an agent-only internal note through the SAME write path a
 * teammate's note button uses (conversation.service.ts's addAgentNote) —
 * reused, not hand-rolled — authored by the assistant's service principal
 * (ensureAssistantPrincipal, the same identity send_block posts as) rather
 * than the engine's principalId-less service actor, since addAgentNote's
 * inserted row needs a real principal to attribute the note to. Loop safety:
 * addAgentNote fires message.note_created same as a human-authored note, but
 * the actor threaded through here stays `principalType: 'service'`
 * (workflowActor(), workflow.engine.ts) and event-trigger.ts's
 * message.note_created mapping does NOT set `allowServiceActor` — so
 * dispatchWorkflowTrigger's automated-actor gate blocks a workflow's own
 * add_note from ever re-triggering a note-triggered workflow. Plain text v1
 * (bounded by MAX_CONVERSATION_MESSAGE_LENGTH at the schema, workflow.schemas.ts)
 * — no rich body / mentions yet.
 *
 * `set_ticket_status` resolves the conversation's linked CUSTOMER ticket
 * (getLinkedCustomerTicket, the same join the unified detail panel reads) and
 * calls the tickets domain's setTicketStatus with a locally widened actor
 * (ticketActionActor) — no linked ticket throws, which the engine logs as
 * action_failed and continues past, the same policy add_tag/apply_sla already
 * get on a bad ref. Loop safety: setTicketStatus fires ticket.status_changed,
 * and event-trigger.ts's mapping for it does NOT set `allowServiceActor`, so
 * the human-actor gate blocks this action from ever re-triggering a
 * ticket.status_changed workflow. `convert_to_ticket` is a no-op success
 * ('already a ticket') when the conversation already has a linked customer
 * ticket; otherwise it creates one (title from the conversation's subject or
 * its first visitor message, requester the conversation's visitor) via the
 * tickets domain's createTicketCore directly (bypasses createTicket's own
 * permission gate by design — see createTicketCore's doc) and links it via
 * ticket-conversation-link.service's linkTicketToConversation. Both are
 * class-agnostic fire-and-continue side effects, like close/add_note.
