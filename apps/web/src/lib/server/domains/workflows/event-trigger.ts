/**
 * Event bus -> workflow trigger bridge (support platform §4.6, Slice 5d-iii). Maps
 * a dispatched conversation/message event to a WorkflowTrigger and hands it to the
 * dispatcher. Non-conversation events (posts, comments, ...) map to null.
 *
 * Ticket triggers (ticket.created / ticket.status_changed) are conversation-linked
 * tickets ONLY — a ticket event's own payload never carries a conversationId (see
 * ticket.webhooks.ts's EventTicketRef/EventTicketData), and the dispatcher is
 * conversation-keyed (WorkflowTrigger.conversationId is required), so these two
 * event types need an extra async step: dispatchWorkflowsForEvent's own ticket
 * branch below resolves the ticket's linked CUSTOMER conversation (one indexed
 * lookup — ticket_conversations' real primary key leads with ticket_id, wrapped
 * as resolveTicketConversationIdForDispatch — see its own doc for why
 * ticket.created ALSO bounded-retries this lookup a few times before giving up)
 * BEFORE calling eventToWorkflowTrigger, and passes the answer as
 * `resolvedConversationId`. No linked conversation -> the event maps to null (no
 * dispatch). Since eventToWorkflowTrigger itself stays synchronous
 * (events/process.ts's own cheap pre-filter calls it with no resolution info,
 * purely to ask "could this event type ever become a trigger" before enqueuing
 * onto the durable dispatch queue — see the ticket cases below for how that
 * caller is kept working).
 *
 * dispatchWorkflowsForEvent is invoked from the workflow-dispatch BullMQ job
 * (workflow-dispatch-queue.ts) rather than fire-and-forget straight off the
 * event pipeline, so it now lets errors propagate: a throw fails the job and
 * BullMQ retries it (3 attempts, exponential backoff) instead of the trigger
 * being silently dropped. The queue module's worker.on('failed') handler logs
 * a failure once retries are exhausted.
 *
 * This propagation is only safe for failures BEFORE any run starts —
 * interruptWaitingRuns itself, and inside dispatchWorkflowTrigger the workflow
 * listing / condition-context resolution that happens before either execution
 * class begins. Nothing has been written yet at that point, so a clean retry
 * just redoes the same read-only work. Once dispatchWorkflowTrigger starts
 * starting runs, retry-safety is two different properties per class:
 *
 *   - customer_facing (dispatcher.ts's exclusive for-loop) relies on the
 *     partial unique index on workflow_runs (one live run per conversation):
 *     if the winning run's own follow-up work throws (e.g. scheduling its
 *     wait timer) after the run row already committed as running/waiting, a
 *     retry's hasActiveCustomerFacingRun pre-check sees that row and skips
 *     re-starting it; a concurrent insert race is resolved the same way runWorkflow
 *     already documents (23505 caught, treated as never-matched).
 *   - background (dispatcher.ts's Promise.all map) has no such lock — caps
 *     only cover capped workflows — so each workflow's run is wrapped in its
 *     own try/catch instead: one workflow throwing (mid-run, after siblings
 *     already committed) is logged and does not fail the batch, so BullMQ
 *     never retries a background workflow that already ran.

 * SEPARATE server functions, so there is no single call site to move the

 * write the link IN createTicketCore's own transaction via
 * `withBackingConversation`, so their ticket.created always dispatches
 * link-visible. The poll remains for the dialog + convert_to_ticket flows,
 * which still link post-create.)
 *
 * `ticket.status_changed` is unaffected — it fires well after a ticket
 * already exists and is normally linked long before any status changes, so
 * it keeps the original single, immediate lookup.
