/**
 * The workflow dispatcher (support platform §4.6, Slice 5d-ii). One entry point,
 * dispatchWorkflowTrigger, turns a trigger into runs: it gates on a human actor
 * (automated actors never re-trigger workflows — the single most important guard
 * against loops), loads the live workflows for the trigger, resolves the condition
 * snapshot once, then applies the two execution classes:
 *
 *   - customer_facing = EXCLUSIVE per conversation: evaluated in drag order, the
 *     first that actually runs locks the conversation and the rest are skipped;
 *     if a run is already live on the conversation, none start.
 *   - background = PARALLEL: every cap-permitted workflow runs independently.
 *
 * A workflow scoped to specific trigger channels, an audience condition
 * (triggerSettings.audience — dispatcher.guards.ts's audienceAllows) or a
 * send window (triggerSettings.sendWindow — sendWindowAllows) is filtered
 * out before the (costlier) per-person frequency cap is checked. Both read
 * the SAME resolved `ctx` every graph condition in the run reads, so an
 * audience predicate never re-queries. The event-bus handler (Slice 5d-iii)
 * constructs the trigger from a dispatched event and calls this.
 *
 * `opts.targetWorkflowId` narrows the whole flow above to exactly one
 * pre-selected workflow instead of every live workflow for the trigger type —
 * event-trigger.ts's dispatchWorkflowsForEvent uses this for the two
 * timer-driven unresponsive triggers (see DispatchWorkflowTriggerOpts' doc);
 * every guard (channel, audience, send window, frequency cap, the
 * customer_facing exclusive lock) still applies exactly as it would in the
 * generic fan-out, since `live` is just a differently-populated array of the
 * same shape either way.
