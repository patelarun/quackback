/**
 * Durable workflow waits (support platform §4.6, Slice 5e). A 'wait' node parks
 * a run; this is the delayed job that resumes it when the timer fires.
 *
 * On the Postgres queue a delayed job is just a row whose `run_at` is the
 * wait's fire time, so a parked run costs one row rather than a live timer, and
 * a process restart cannot lose it. The dedupe key is the run id plus a per-run
 * wait sequence number, so re-scheduling the same wait (after a retry, or by
 * the sweeper) is a no-op while a later wait in the same run gets its own row.
 * The handler re-loads the run and calls `resumeWorkflowRun`, which itself
 * no-ops if a reply or close interrupted the run in the meantime.
