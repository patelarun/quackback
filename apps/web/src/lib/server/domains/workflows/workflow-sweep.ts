 * the setting at park time (see workflow.engine.ts's applyPlanAndSettle), so

 *
 * Two steps per expired run, in this order:
 *
 *  1. Guarded settle to 'interrupted' (guarded on state='waiting', mirroring
 *     sweepStaleRunningRuns's guard on 'running' — the analogous race: a
 *     customer's reply or a teammate/close interrupt landing between the
 *     select and this update must win, so the guarded update simply no-ops
 *     for the loser instead of clobbering it). Logs 'swept_expired'.
 *  2. The close decision (closeIfAbandoned) — ONLY reached once the settle
 *     above actually took effect, and only after it committed.
 *
 * This ordering matters for loop-safety: closeIfAbandoned's close raises a
 * conversation.status_changed event (dispatched asynchronously off this
 * call, via the workflow-dispatch queue — see event-trigger.ts's module
 * doc), which on a close normally resumes a parked assistant-wait or
 * interrupts every other waiting run on the conversation. By the time that
 * event is actually processed, THIS run is already 'interrupted' (step 1
 * committed first, synchronously, before the close is even issued) — so
 * event-trigger.ts's findWaitingCustomerFacingRun finds nothing to resume or
 * re-interrupt on this run. No circularity: the just-expired run cannot be
 * "closed back into" by its own sweep.
 *
 * `keepIfEmailCaptured` is read once per sweep tick (not stamped per-run at
 * park time, unlike `enabled`/`waitMinutes` — see the engine's stamping doc)
 * so a workspace that flips it mid-flight has every run in this tick decided
 * by the current value, not whatever was configured when each one parked.

 * pin an exact instant without an extra message-id lookup. That anchor is
 * stable for the entire life of one continuous silence period (it only moves
 * when a NEW message arrives, which flips which trigger type even applies),

 * Scan + dispatch both SLA timer triggers. `sla.approaching_breach` scans at
 * the WIDEST `breachLeadMinutes` configured across every live workflow of
 * that type (see sla.sweep.ts's module doc for why one scalar marker can't
 * fire each live workflow independently at ITS OWN lead); `sla.breached` has
 * no configurable lead, so it only needs a live-workflow existence check.
 * Each trigger scans TWO axes per tick, sharing the same live-workflow
 * pre-check and lead resolution: the conversation clocks (sla.sweep.ts) and
 * the ticket-anchored TTR clock (ticket-sla.sweep.ts). A scanned ticket
 * candidate dispatches the same synthetic event shape as a conversation one,
 * extended with the ticket identity (`ticketId` + `ticket` ref) and
 * conversationId/conversation pointing at the ticket's linked CUSTOMER
 * conversation — all workflow runs are conversation-context, so a ticket
 * clock's trigger rides the conversation the ticket is anchored to. The
 * ticket scans already skip back-office tickets entirely (no customer
 * conversation to run against; their marker is claimed inline — see
 * ticket-sla.sweep.ts's resolveTicketTriggerTarget), so every candidate
 * reaching here dispatches. Returns the total number of synthetic events
 * fired.
 *
 * CLAIM-AFTER-ENQUEUE: the scans return candidates WITHOUT their fire-once
 * marker claimed. Per candidate, this pass first enqueues the dispatch (a
 * deterministic BullMQ jobId per (trigger, conversation-or-ticket, clock,
 * dueAt) — a sibling tick racing the same candidate enqueues the SAME id and
 * is deduped by the queue), and only claims the marker (CAS) once the
 * enqueue succeeded. An enqueue failure therefore leaves the marker unset
 * and the next tick retries — under the old claim-then-dispatch order that
 * same failure lost the trigger forever, the claimed marker suppressing every
 * later scan. A claim that misses AFTER a successful enqueue only ever means
 * a sibling tick claimed first (harmless: the queue already holds exactly
 * one job) or the clock settled/paused/re-applied meanwhile (the stamp stays
 * truthful: the trigger never fired for that clock state).
