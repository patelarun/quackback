/**
 * IMAP inbound poller — a once-a-minute job that pulls unseen mail from a
 * configured IMAP mailbox and feeds it to the shared ingest core (Layer 1 for
 * self-hosters, no provider webhook required).
 *
 * Under BullMQ this was a repeatable job with `every: 60_000`; here it is a
 * `* * * * *` cron on the job definition. Same cadence, and the same
 * once-per-slot guarantee, now enforced by the unique index on
 * `(queue, dedupe_key)` rather than by a stable BullMQ job id.
 *
 * **The gate moved from construction to scheduling, deliberately.** The old
 * shape simply never built the worker when IMAP was unconfigured. A cron that
 * enqueued anyway and returned early from the handler would write 1,440 no-op
 * rows a day per workspace, so `isEmailImapPollable()` gates the schedule instead:
 * nothing is written at all.
 *
 * **It refuses to schedule under pooled tenancy, and that is the honest
 * answer.** The mailbox is configured from process environment — one mailbox
 * for the whole process — while the queue is per workspace. Scheduling it on every
 * workspace's loop would have each workspace poll the *same* mailbox and ingest the
 * same message into its own database. That is a cross-workspace data movement, so
 * it fails closed and says why. It is not a regression: under pooled tenancy
 * the BullMQ worker was never started either (`startup.ts` refuses the whole
 * registry), so this replaces a silent absence with a stated refusal.
