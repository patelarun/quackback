/**
 * Ephemeral snapshot of Quinn's live activity trace, held in the Postgres KV
 * cache.
 *
 * The widget's working trace ("Thinking...", "Searching the knowledge
 * base...") is published as a fire-and-forget event on the conversation
 * channel, which only reaches subscribers already connected at publish time.
 * A brand-new conversation's stream connects AFTER the turn starts, so the
 * first "thinking" event is lost and the visible trace starts mid-turn (or
 * not at all, for a short answer). Treating the trace as state fixes this: the
 * latest activity is mirrored into the cache on every publish, and a subscriber
 * that connects mid-turn reads it once, right after subscribing, to replay
 * the current state as its first frame.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout, via the shared cache helpers: a cache failure must
 * never fail the turn or the stream.
