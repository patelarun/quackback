/**
 * `process.ts` is the sole enqueuer onto the `events` hook queue.
 *
 * That is what makes delivery effectively-once: every job it writes
 * carries a deterministic `<eventId>:<sink>:<target>` dedupe key, so a
 * retried dispatch re-enqueues the same keys and the unique index turns
 * the repeat into a no-op. A module that reached the queue directly
 * would supply no such key, and its jobs would be delivered again on
 * every retry.
 *
 * `emit.ts` writes the `event-dispatch` job in the same transaction as
 * the outbox row — a different queue, same primitive. This gate fails
 * if any other `events/` module imports the job queue's enqueue functions.
 *
 * The construct it names is the one that exists **now**. An earlier version of
 * this gate looked for a BullMQ `Queue` and `addBulk`; the package is banned
 * outright by `policy/no-bullmq`, so those spellings are unreachable and a gate
 * that only looked for them could no longer fail.

/**
 * The modules that own a queue: name, dedupe key, attempt limit.
 *
 * `event-dispatch-queue.ts` is here because it sweeps relay-owned events onto
 * the `event-dispatch` queue, and writes them under the *same*
 * `event-dispatch:<eventId>` key and attempt limit `emit.ts` uses. Two writers
 * for one queue is safe only while the key is identical: a sweep of an event
 * `emit.ts` already enqueued collides on the unique index and no-ops, which is
 * the property this gate exists to protect rather than the single-writer rule
 * as such.
