 * ticks relied on the queue keying its job off that deterministic id — but the
 * outbox mints a FRESH `eventId` per row, so without a dedupe key a later tick
 * over the same still-qualifying condition would write a new row and re-fire.
 * For these types we thread the deterministic id into the outbox `dedupeKey`, so
 * `events_dedupe_idx` collapses repeated ticks the way the queue used to. Scoped
 * to the transitional bridge deliberately: everyday events carry no dedupe key
