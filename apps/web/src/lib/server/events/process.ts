/**
 * Event processing — the producer side of the `events` queue.
 *
 * Hooks are delivered by the Postgres job queue (`jobs/`), whose handler lives
 * in `hook-job.ts`. This module writes the event to the durable outbox and
 * offers the two enqueue shapes the rest of the system needs: the relay's bulk,
 * deterministically-keyed enqueue, and the scheduler's cancelable delayed one.
 *
 * A failed delivery is not lost: the job row keeps its `last_error` and its
 * attempt count, and terminal rows are retained per queue (30 days for a failed
 * `events` job) so *"did this webhook actually fire?"* stays answerable —
 * `SELECT … FROM job_queue WHERE queue = 'events'` in place of what used to be
 * a Redis failed-set inspection.
