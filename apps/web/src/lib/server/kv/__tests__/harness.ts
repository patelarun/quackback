/**
 * Real-Postgres harness for the KV / presence / realtime suites.
 *
 * These substrates replaced Redis, and the properties that matter about them —
 * atomicity under concurrency, TTL semantics, and workspace separation — are
 * properties of *statements executing against a real server*. A fake `db` would
 * let every one of these suites pass while the shipped SQL was wrong, which is
 * exactly the shape this run has caught nineteen times.
 *
 * **Every key is unique per test.** `DATABASE_URL` is hard-coded to one shared
 * `quackback_test` for every worktree and agent on the machine, so a suite that
 * asserted whole-table state would fail on somebody else's row. Nothing here
 * counts rows it did not write.
