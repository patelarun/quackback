/**
 * The lease primitive itself, with the table it operates on as a parameter.
 *
 * `SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md` §7.2 describes one primitive and §10.3 names its
 * second consumer explicitly: *"Claiming: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` + lease —
 * the same primitive §7.2 already requires. Fleet migration is its second
 * consumer, not a new subsystem."* This module is what makes that literally
 * true rather than aspirationally true.
 *
 * Two consumers today:
 *
 * | Consumer | Table | Database |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `job-queue.ts` | `job_queue` | the workspace's own |
 * | `fleet/schema-state.ts` | `cp_workspace_schema_state` | the control plane's |
 *
 * They cannot share a *function*, because they run against different databases
 * with different row shapes. They can share the statements, and the statements
 * are where every load-bearing property lives:
 *
 * 1. **`attempts` is incremented by the CLAIM**, never by completion. A row
 *    with `max_attempts = 1` that was claimed even once already reads
 *    `attempts = 1`, so it is spent whether or not anything reported back.
 * 2. **`attempts < max_attempts` gates the claim *and* the reaper's requeue.**
 *    A spent row is not claimable and is not requeueable; an expired lease on
 *    one becomes terminal `failed` with a named reason.
 * 3. **Every write after the claim is guarded by `lease_token`.** A process
 *    that stalls past its lease, is reaped, then resumes and reports success
 *    updates zero rows and is told its lease was lost.
 *
 * Those three were proved on `job_queue` — 70 SIGKILLs at uniformly random
 * instants and 4 concurrent reapers against 4 concurrent drainers, zero double
 * executions, with a positive control (`maxAttempts: 3`) establishing that the
 * harness can see a double when there is one. **Because the statements now live
 * here, that proof covers this module**, and breaking anything below turns
 * `__tests__/job-queue.test.ts` and `scripts/job-lease-proof.ts kill-matrix`
 * red. A second implementation would have inherited none of it.
 *
 * ## What a consumer must provide
 *
 * A table with these columns, and the shape `CHECK` that makes a NULL
 * `locked_until` impossible to read as "expired":
 *
 * ```
 * id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY
 * status text          -- 'pending' | 'running' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'
 * run_at timestamptz   attempts int   max_attempts int
 * lease_token uuid     locked_until timestamptz   locked_by text
 * last_error text      started_at / finished_at / updated_at timestamptz
 * CHECK ((status = 'running') = (lease_token IS NOT NULL AND locked_until IS NOT NULL))
 * ```

 * not consume another's capacity and a long lock on one queue did not lengthen
 * anyone else's. A single `LIMIT` over a union of queues loses both properties:
 * `help-center-translate`'s 120s lease would be applied to a `snooze-sweep` row
 * claimed in the same batch, and one queue's backlog would fill the batch. The
 * `LATERAL` below is what restores them — one query per pass regardless of
 * group count, but each group's own limit and its own lease.
 *
 * The group table arrives as a JSON object rather than Postgres array literals:
 * Drizzle's `sql` template flattens a JS array into one parameter per element,
 * so `= ANY($1::text[])` arrives as a bare string and Postgres rejects it as a
 * malformed array. This shape parameterises cleanly and leaves the value opaque
 * to the parser. Its columns are named `grp`/`lim`/`lease_secs` so no group
 * column can collide with the leased table's own, which is what keeps
 * `CLAIMABLE` above spellable unqualified.
