/**
 * No registered handler module defers a module to call time.
 *
 * **Read the title literally — it is one level deep, and it used to overclaim.**
 * This scan reads exactly the seven wrapper files named by `JOB_DEFINITIONS`. A
 * call-time `import()` one level below, inside `sla.sweep.ts`, kept this file
 * green while that module's top level ran under a workspace scope on the pooled
 * fleet.
 *
 * `primeJobHandlers()` imports each handler module once at tier start, before
 * any workspace scope is open, so no module executes its top level under one
 * workspace's connection. That guarantee reaches exactly as far as the *static*
 * import graph: a `await import(...)` inside a handler body runs at call time,
 * which is inside the per-pass workspace scope, and `resolveHandler`'s warning
 * cannot see it because it only guards the outer import.
 *
 * This was real rather than theoretical. Three of the seven handler modules
 * deferred their sweep modules to call time, and a top-level probe in
 * `sla.sweep.ts` read `(module not imported)` after priming and
 * `inst_cloud_alpha` after the job worker ran the sweep — the module's top level
 * executed under a workspace scope, with no warning possible.
 *
 * Deepening it was measured and rejected rather than skipped. The modules these
 * seven statically import include `conversation.service` (6 call-time imports),
 * `pending-actions.service` (2) and `settings.service` (24) — ordinary lazy
 * loading throughout the app, none of it queue-specific. A scan that flagged
 * those would either fail on day one or need an allowlist that grows forever,
 * and neither is a guard.
 *
 * So the boundary is stated rather than blurred. **The queue guarantees the
 * handler wrappers and their static graph are loaded before any scope opens.**
 * It does not, and cannot, guarantee that about the whole application's lazy
 * graph: a module imported at call time runs under whatever scope its caller
 * has, which for a request is the *correct* workspace. That only becomes a hazard
 * when such a module captures scope-dependent state at its top level, and is
 * then shared process-wide.
 *
 * **That makes the boundary a cross-piece contract rather than a self-contained
 * guarantee, so name where the other half lives:**
 * `lib/server/policy/module-state/` — the §4.4 scanner — owns every
 * module-scope mutable-state site *it can see* under `lib/server/**`, reconciled
 * against a checked-in ledger, with its recall limits recorded in that module's
 * README. It is a *source* scan, so load order is irrelevant to it: it sees a
 * captured singleton whether the module was imported at prime time, at call
 * time, or never.
 *
 * **This test's boundary is therefore sound to exactly the degree that scanner's
 * recall is** — not absolutely. And one gap is invisible from its ledger:
 * `walkSourceFiles` skips `__tests__` and `*.test.ts`, so a captured singleton
 * in a server-side test helper is outside the contract entirely.
 *
 * A source scan is the right instrument because the property is about *when* a
 * module loads, which no runtime assertion in this process can observe after the
 * fact: once a module is in the registry there is no record of the scope it was
 * imported under. `priming.test.ts` pins the other half — that priming actually
 * runs.
