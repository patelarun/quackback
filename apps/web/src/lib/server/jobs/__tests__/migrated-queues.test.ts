/**
 * The eight migrated queues, at the two seams a definition table cannot cover.
 *
 * **The enqueue site.** `import` and `export` state `maxAttempts: 1` at their
 * own enqueue call as well as on the definition, because that is the property
 * a reader of the import path needs to see and it is too costly to leave
 * implicit in one place. Two statements of one rule need two tests, or the
 * second is decoration a refactor can drop unnoticed.
 *
 * **The schedule gate.** `email-imap` refuses to schedule under pooled tenancy:
 * its mailbox is process-wide configuration while the queue is per workspace, so
 * scheduling it on every workspace's loop would have each workspace poll the same
 * mailbox and ingest the same message into its own database. Nothing else in
 * the suite would notice that refusal disappearing.
