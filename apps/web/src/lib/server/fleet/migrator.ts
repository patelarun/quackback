/**
 * `QUACKBACK_ROLE=migrator` — the fleet migration executor and its reconcile
 * pass (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §10.3).
 *
 * ## Why the executor is the app image
 *
 * The migrations are bundled in `packages/db/drizzle`. If the control plane ran
 * them, version affinity between "which SQL" and "which code" would have to be
 * maintained by hand across two repositories, and the first time they disagreed
 * a workspace would be migrated to a schema no running build knows about. So the
 * CP records intent and this image reconciles toward it.
 *
 * ## Which executor route, and why
 *
 * §10.3 as written was not implementable: it said `runMigrations(connStr)` +
 * `ensureConcurrentIndexes()`, but `ensureConcurrentIndexes` was private to
 * `packages/db/src/migrate.ts` and *that file calls `runMigrations()` at module
 * top level*, so importing it ran migrations as a side effect. The two available
 * routes were to spawn the CLI as a child process, or to export the steps as
 * callable units.
 *
 * **Callable units, in-process.** Three reasons, in order of weight:
 *
 * 1. **The heal and the verification bracket the migration.** Invalid indexes
 *    must be dropped *before* the build and the catalogue swept *after*, and
 *    each step's failure has to be reportable on its own. A child process
 *    offers one exit code and stderr to scrape; distinguishing "the extension
 *    could not be created" from "an index is invalid" would mean parsing log
 *    lines, which is a contract nobody wrote down.
 * 2. **`migrate.ts` calls `process.exit(1)` on failure.** In-process that would
 *    kill the migrator mid-fleet, so the CLI route is not merely inconvenient,
 *    it forces the child-process shape rather than being chosen for it.
 * 3. **Concurrency.** §10.3 wants ~20 workspaces at a time; that is 20 Node
 *    processes each re-parsing the whole drizzle schema and re-reading 228 SQL
 *    files. In-process they share one module graph.
 *
 * The cost is honest and worth stating: `packages/db` gained a leaf module
 * (`schema-ops.ts`) and `migrate.ts` became a thin wrapper over the same
 * executor. That is a *reduction* in duplication — the concurrent-index list now
 * exists once and is used by the creator, the heal and the post-condition check.
 *
 * ## The two things the ledger cannot tell you
 *
 * `migrate()` wraps the whole lineage in one transaction, so the lineage is
 * atomic — measured, never partial. **But only `migrate()` is atomic.** The
 * extension creation, the index builds and the seed run outside it, so a kill in
 * the tail leaves a complete ledger and a broken database. Everything this
 * module reports about correctness therefore comes from the catalogue, and
 * `appliedCount` is carried alongside as a diagnostic rather than as evidence.
 *
 * Second: a ledger row is written by drizzle *after it executed the statements*.
 * Nothing here ever inserts one. A workspace whose ledger is behind its own schema
 * — which is the state five live fleet databases are in, because they were
 * migrated with `psql -f` — is healed by replaying the SQL, not by asserting
 * that it ran. A wrong ledger row is worse than a missing one.
 *
 * ## Gaps, and the division of labour that used to leave them stuck
 *
 * Drizzle applies every bundled entry above `max(created_at)` and never looks
 * below it, so a ledger with a *hole* is invisible to the migrator while being
 * exactly what the compatibility gate refuses. That split — the reconciler
 * advances the tip, the gate detects holes — has a dead end in it, because the
 * gate can only refuse. Measured on two live workspaces: high-water at `0253` with
 * rows absent for `0249`, `0250`, `0251` and `0252`, `settings.cloud`
 * physically missing, every page 500ing, and both instruments reporting fine —
 * the reconciler `OK [reconciled] post=true`, having applied two migrations and
 * healed nothing.
 *
 * {@link ledgerGapFor} finds the hole and {@link gapHealVerdict} decides whether
 * it may be closed; the close itself is a DELETE and nothing else. The direction
 * is the safety argument: a DELETE can only make the ledger claim *less*, every
 * surviving row is still drizzle's own evidence, and the rows that come back are
 * written by drizzle after it has run the SQL again. Under-claiming is the
 * recoverable direction — a ledger describing less than its database is replayed
 * forward; one describing more is a false answer nothing can detect.

 *   back (nothing here inserts a ledger row) the workspace is left under-claiming
 *   further than it started, with no run that can ever succeed. Refusing before
 *   the DELETE is the only protection, which is why this runs first.
 * - **`missing` — the hole itself.** Nobody knows whether these ran; that is what
 *   makes it a hole. `errors` is acceptable for the same reason it is acceptable
 *   in an ordinary rollout: `migrate()` wraps the lineage in one transaction, so
 *   the run rolls back whole and Postgres's own message is the diagnosis.
 *   `mutates` is refused, because a statement that succeeds and writes a second
 *   time is the class atomicity cannot save you from.
 *
 * **`allowMutatingReplay` does not reach this gate, deliberately.** That flag
 * means "the operator has established that this ledger is honest". A gap is
