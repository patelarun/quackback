/**
 * `cp_workspace_schema_state` — the control plane's migration intent, read and
 * written by the app (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §10.3).
 *
 * The direction of the arrows is the whole design: **the control plane records
 * intent; the app reconciles toward it.** The CP now owns product writes of
 * `target_version` / `cohort` / `blocked` (provision enrol, `/admin`, MCP).
 * This module still exposes `setTargetVersion` / `ensureSchemaStateRow` /
 * `blockWorkspace` for the `fleet-migrator` CLI. The migrator claims a row,
 * does the work, and writes back only what it *observed*. Neither side writes
 * the other's columns, so "what should happen" and "what did happen" cannot be
 * confused for one another during an incident.
 *
 * ## Why claiming is not a new mechanism
 *
 * Every statement below comes from `jobs/lease.ts`, which is the primitive the
 * Postgres job queue already uses — 70 SIGKILLs at random instants, 4 concurrent
 * reapers against 4 concurrent drainers, zero double executions, with a positive
 * control proving the harness can see a double. §10.3 says fleet migration is
 * *"its second consumer, not a new subsystem"*, and this module is what makes
 * that true at the level of the SQL rather than at the level of the prose.
 *
 * The one property worth restating here because it matters more for migration
 * than for jobs: **`attempts` is incremented by the CLAIM.** A migrator killed
 * halfway through a workspace has already spent an attempt, so a workspace whose
 * migration reliably kills the process cannot loop — it exhausts `max_attempts`
 * and goes terminal with a diagnosis. Without that, a poisonous workspace would
 * wake its workspace database forever, which is the exact cost the architecture exists
 * to avoid.
 *
 * ## The connection
 *
 * The control database is reached through `getControlSql()`, the same tiny,
 * long-lived, non-workspace connection the registry reader uses. It is a direct
 * connection by construction: the control plane is a single always-warm
 * Postgres, not a per-workspace compute behind a transaction pooler.
