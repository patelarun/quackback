-- Fleet migration intent (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §10.3).
--
-- Under pooled compute one code version serves tenants on two schema versions
-- for the duration of every rollout. `deploy.preDeployCommand` cannot migrate
-- them: it runs once per deploy, not once per tenant, and making it iterate
-- would put a multi-hour fleet migration on the deploy critical path.
--
-- So the control plane records INTENT and the app RECONCILES toward it. This
-- table is the intent. It holds no SQL, no migration content and no schedule —
-- the migrations are bundled in the app image (`packages/db/drizzle`), which is
-- what stops version affinity from having to be maintained by hand across two
-- repositories. What lives here is: which tenants should be at which version,
-- what happened last time, and the lease that stops two migrator replicas
-- working the same tenant.
--
-- ## Why it carries a lease and not just a status
--
-- Claiming is `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` + lease — the same primitive the job
-- queue already requires (§7.2), because the row lock released by SKIP LOCKED
-- vanishes the instant the claiming transaction commits, and a tenant migration
-- is minutes of work outside any transaction. The columns below are therefore
-- deliberately the same shape as the tenant-side `job_queue`: one set of
-- statements drives both, so the at-most-once proof done on that table is the
-- proof for this one. Do not "simplify" the shape; the shape IS the reuse.
--
-- ## The three columns that are not the lease
--
--   target_version   what the CP wants. A journal `when` millis, so it is
--                    orderable and directly comparable with what the tenant
--                    database's own drizzle ledger reports.
--   current_version  what was last OBSERVED in the tenant database, written
--                    only after a run whose post-conditions were verified
--                    against the catalogue. Never written from the ledger
--                    alone: a run killed in the tail leaves a complete ledger
--                    and a broken database.
--   cohort           the rollout unit (§10.8): canary, then ~5%, then fleet.
--                    A claim narrows on it, so halting a rollout is a
--                    single-row update rather than a deploy.
--
-- ## Expand/contract
--
-- This migration is additive only: one new table, no change to any existing
-- one. A control plane running the previous code ignores it entirely, which is
-- the ordering rule (§10.1) applied to the control plane's own schema.
