/**
 * Refusals a retry cannot fix, and what to do instead of retrying.
 *
 * ## The measurement
 *
 * Two workspaces on a live fleet were refused with `app_secret_no_resolver` — their
 * `appSecretsRef` names a secret store this build has no resolver for. The tiers
 * reconnected anyway. One of them was the **most active database in the fleet at
 * 70%**, its newest connection 1.6 seconds old, doing no work of any kind. A
 * configuration-terminal refusal was being answered by a reconnect loop at the
 * poll interval, and the cost was a compute that could never suspend.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Classify, then choose the wait. `fingerprint.ts` already draws the line
 * between the two subjects of a refusal (wrong database vs wrong key) and now
 * also answers the second question — can a retry change this? Everything it
 * calls terminal is an accusation about a record or a key, and this module adds
 * the codes the secret resolver raises before a fingerprint is ever taken.
 *
 * - **Terminal** → stop retrying. Resume when the workspace's registry `revision`
 *   changes, because the control plane's trigger bumps it on any write to the
 *   record — including the hand-run `UPDATE` that fixes it. Re-probe once per
 *   `rescanIntervalMs` regardless, because not every repair is a registry
 *   change: a custody repair writes the *workspace* database and leaves the record
 *   untouched, and a workspace that could only ever be freed by a revision bump
 *   would stay refused after being fixed.
 * - **Transient** → exponential backoff, capped. A compute that is still
 *   starting, a schema floor the migrator has not reached yet, a credential
 *   mid-rotation: all of these heal on their own, and all of them are made worse
 *   by a tight loop.
 *
 * ## Visibility is the hard requirement, not the wait
 *
 * A workspace that stops being retried and says nothing is worse than the retry
 * storm, because the storm at least had a symptom. So quarantine is loud on
 * entry, loud again on a fixed heartbeat for as long as it lasts, and readable
 * from the job-worker status the readiness probe already publishes. The heartbeat is
 * the part that matters: entry logs scroll away, and the operator who needs this
 * is the one arriving hours later asking why a workspace is not being served.
