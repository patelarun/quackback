/**
 * Asking a workspace database who it belongs to, and deciding whether to believe it.
 *
 * SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §3, stated plainly: if workspace resolution returns the
 * wrong pool, every RBAC and permission check still passes, because that
 * database's own `settings`, `principal` and `roles` rows are entirely
 * self-consistent. It does not error. It looks correct. There is no second gate,
 * so this is the gate.
 *
 * Three independent facts are checked, and each covers a hole in the others:
 *
 * | Fact | Written by | Beaten by |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `settings.id` | nobody — it is a primary key | a copy of the database |
 * | the control plane's stamp | the CP, deliberately | a copy of the database |
 * | `pg_database.oid` | the catalog, per database | nothing we can reach |
 *
 * The verdict for the first two is `evaluateFingerprint`, vendored byte-for-byte
 * from the control plane so both sides run the same predicate rather than two
 * prose readings of it. The third is `evaluatePhysicalIdentity`, which exists
 * because branching copies data and therefore copies both of the first two.
 *
 * ## Where the stamp is read from
 *
 * Preferentially from `settings.cloud_workspace_key`, a dedicated column
 * (migration 0251). The stamp's original home is the `settings.metadata` JSON
 * bag, and `telemetry/instance-id.ts` performs an unlocked, unattended **hourly**
 * read-modify-write of that same bag which never invalidates the settings cache —
 * so it can interleave with a stamp write and drop it. A column removes the whole
 * class rather than narrowing the window.
 *
 * The column is read through `to_jsonb(s) ->> 'cloud_workspace_key'` rather than by
 * name, so this query still runs against a database that predates 0251 and
 * simply reports the column as absent. That matters because the fingerprint is
 * the *first* thing a pooled process does with a workspace database — refusing to
 * even look because of an ordering problem would turn an expand-only migration
 * into an outage.
 *
 * When both sources are present and disagree, that is a refusal in its own
 * right: two writers claiming different owners is not a state to pick a winner
 * from.
