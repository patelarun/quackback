/**
 * The workspace registry contract.
 *
 * This module is the written form of the seam between the control plane and the
 * pooled app fleet. The CP writes registry records; the app resolves the Host
 * header to one on every request, before auth runs and before it spends a
 * database connection. `docs/WORKSPACE-REGISTRY-CONTRACT.md` is the same contract
 * stated for the app team; this file is what the CP enforces.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing, and every design choice below serves one
 * of them.
 *
 * 1. COMPLETE. A record carries everything needed to serve a request. There is
 *    no field the app is expected to infer, default, or parse out of another
 *    field. If a value is per-workspace it is a field; if it is fleet-wide it is
 *    deliberately absent (see the doc's "deliberately absent" section).
 *
 * 2. FAIL CLOSED. Per SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §3 there is no second gate: if
 *    workspace resolution returns the wrong pool, every RBAC check still passes,
 *    because that database's own rows are self-consistent. It does not error;
 *    it looks correct. So anything less than a wholly valid, active, fingerprinted
 *    record must be unusable rather than partially usable. That is expressed
 *    here as a type: {@link WorkspaceResolution} only carries connection material
 *    in its `ok` variant, so there is no way to reach a DSN from a suspended,
 *    unknown or malformed record.
 *
 * 3. VERIFIABLE. The record names the fingerprint the workspace database must
 *    carry. {@link evaluateFingerprint} is the exact predicate the app runs on
 *    pool checkout; it lives here rather than in prose so both sides test the
 *    same function.

 *
 * "In a way a reader must notice" is the whole of the test, and it is narrower
 * than "the shape changed". The gate below is exact equality, not a floor, so a
 * bump is not a compatibility signal — it is a fleet-wide refusal that lasts
 * until every replica carries the new reader. Purely ADDITIVE fields therefore
 * do not bump it: an older reader that ignores a new column serves exactly what
 * it served before, and trading that for a 503 on every hostname buys nothing.
