/**
 * The vendored contract must stay byte-identical to the control plane's.
 *
 * `evaluateFingerprint` is the predicate that decides whether this fleet may
 * serve a database. It lives in one function, in one file, on purpose: two
 * repos independently *reading* the same prose is exactly how one of them ends
 * up with a slightly more forgiving version, and the forgiving one is the one
 * that serves the wrong workspace.
 *
 * Copying is the pragmatic answer — the app cannot import from the control
 * plane at build time — so the copy needs a tripwire. Two, in fact:
 *
 * 1. **A committed digest.** Always runs, everywhere, with no dependency on
 *    another checkout. Editing the vendored file without editing this constant
 *    fails CI, which forces the change to be deliberate and reviewable.
 * 2. **A direct comparison** against the control-plane checkout when one is
 *    present. That catches drift in the OTHER direction — the control plane
 *    changing while this copy stands still — which the digest alone cannot see.
 *
 * The second check is skipped when the sibling repo is absent, and a skipped
 * check reports success. That is precisely why it is not the only check.
