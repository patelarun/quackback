/**
 * Who can reach a scope's secrets, and what a scope's existence proves.
 *
 * `WorkspaceScope` used to carry `secrets: ResolvedWorkspaceSecrets` as a public
 * field, so every holder of a scope held this workspace's `SECRET_KEY` **and**
 * its storage credential pair. Under SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §9 — one bucket for
 * the fleet, one credential, a per-workspace key prefix — that pair is an
 * addressing capability for the whole bucket, and the provider no longer
 * enforces the boundary the application now has to.
 *
 * The base branch made the storage client workspace-scoped and turned
 * `getS3Config()` module-private for exactly that reason. Leaving the same pair
 * on the scope would have moved the door rather than closed it: `getWorkspaceScope`
 * is exported, and it answered the same question in one call.
 *
 * Two consumers have a real need. `secret-key.ts` wants the signing key;
 * `storage/s3.ts` wants the storage credential. Everything else that holds a
 * scope — the magic-link and claims stashes re-entering it, `sweep-lock`'s null
 * check, `storage/workspace-scope.ts`'s namespace read — wants the workspace's
 * identity. So each of the two gets an accessor that returns its own material
 * and no part of the other's, and neither returns a bucket.
 *
 * What must NOT change, and what these tests pin alongside the narrowing:
 *
 * - The secrets are resolved on the same pool-checkout pass as the fingerprint
 *   (§4.3, "atomically with `databaseUrl`"). Making the accessors async, or
 *   resolving lazily at the point of use, would reintroduce a mixed-up-credential
 *   class that is currently not expressible.
 * - The readers are synchronous. `activeSecretKey()` is called from session
 *   verification, token signing and `encryption.ts`; none of those can await.
 * - A scope existing at all means the `SECRET_KEY` half resolved. That was
 *   carried by the type, and the type is precisely what stops carrying it once
 *   `secrets` leaves the shape — so it is carried by the constructor now.
