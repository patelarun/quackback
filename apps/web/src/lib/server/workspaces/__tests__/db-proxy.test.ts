/**
 * The `db` Proxy trap: `this` binding, and what happens with no workspace.
 *
 * 537 files import `db`. None of them changes, which is only true because the
 * Proxy absorbs the difference — so the trap itself is the thing that has to be
 * right.
 *
 * Two properties, and both used to be untested:
 *
 * 1. **A method called on the proxy runs with the real handle as `this`.** The
 *    old trap returned the raw property, so `db.select(...)` ran with
 *    `this === proxy`. That worked only because `getDatabase()` returned one
 *    memoized singleton, which made the re-entrant lookups resolve to the same
 *    object anyway. Once the trap can return *different* handles, an unbound
 *    method would re-enter the trap for its own internals and could pick up a
 *    different workspace's session mid-statement.
 * 2. **Under pooled workspaces, no scope is an error, not a default.** There is no
 *    fleet-wide database to fall back to, and a fallback is how §3's failure
 *    mode — serving another workspace's data while every permission check passes —
 *    would come back in a new costume.
