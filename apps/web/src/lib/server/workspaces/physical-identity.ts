/**
 * The half of the fingerprint a copy of the database cannot forge.
 *
 * `evaluateFingerprint` (vendor/contract.ts) compares two facts that live *in*
 * the workspace database: `settings.id` and the control plane's stamp. Both are
 * data, and `pg_dump`/`CREATE DATABASE … TEMPLATE` copy data — so a clone of a
 * workspace's database satisfies both halves and is served as the real thing
 * unless something that is a property of the *catalog* is compared too.
 *
 * On the fleet Postgres that comparison is `current_database()` plus
 * `pg_database.oid`, recorded at provision, plus the cluster id the registry
 * named. A restore into a new database keeps the stamp and `settings.id` and
 * gets a new oid. A `TEMPLATE` clone does the same. Refusing an oid mismatch is
 * the anti-clone half.
 *
 * A record that claims no catalog oid (self-host) skips this check.
 *
 * Catalog fields are read with ordinary SQL so a self-hosted database answers
 * them.
