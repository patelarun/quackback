/**
 * Which (tenancy, role) configurations a process may boot in.
 *
 * This file used to assert the opposite. An earlier fix put a refusal in the
 * config schema — pooled tenancy would only boot with `QUACKBACK_ROLE=web` —
 * and that composed with the pooled job worker, which is gated ON
 * `shouldRunWorkers()` and therefore never starts on `web`, into a fleet with
 * **no runnable pooled configuration at all**. Two guards, each correct alone,
 * jointly specifying an impossible system.
 *
 * It also contradicted the architecture it was implementing: the job worker
 * must be allowed to boot under pooled tenancy. Cloud now runs that tier
 * in the tenant-facing process (`QUACKBACK_ROLE=all` + scheduler). `worker`
 * remains a valid role for leftover soak capacity and for optional scale-out.
 *
 * So the role is free again, and the refusal moved to the noun it was always
 * about. It first became a seam that would not construct a `Worker` under
 * pooled tenancy; now that the queues it guarded run on the job worker,
 * it is the stricter and simpler property that no file under `apps/web/src`
 * imports the queue package at all — you cannot construct a `Worker` without
 * importing it. Pinned in `policy/no-bullmq/__tests__/no-bullmq.test.ts`.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the **permitted** matrix, not just the forbidden
 * one. A test that only lists refusals cannot notice that everything is
 * refused, which is precisely how the previous version passed while making the
 * fleet unbootable.
