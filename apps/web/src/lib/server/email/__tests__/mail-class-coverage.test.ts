/**
 * Every mail template must be classified before it can ship.
 *
 * A new `send*Email` export is the moment someone decides where its recipient
 * comes from, and it is the moment that decision is easiest to make by accident
 * — copy an adjacent caller, inherit its recipient, done. This fails CI until
 * the class is stated, which is cheap now and expensive to reconstruct later.
 *
 * This is the only hand-maintained list left. The `account` and `sealed` classes
 * used to be restated in an ESLint allow-list and a source-scanning test as
 * well, all three of which had to move together; the senders now declare
 * `to: SecureRecipient` themselves, so the compiler enforces that part and the
 * other two lists are gone. What a type cannot state is that a NEW template was
 * considered at all, which is what this checks.
