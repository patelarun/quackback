/**
 * In-process concurrency caps for the SSE stream endpoint (Phase 6 R1).
 *
 * Three bounds now, and the reason for the third is the whole point of this
 * module under pooling:
 *
 * - a **global** cap, a file-descriptor backstop for the single Bun process;
 * - a **per-workspace** cap, so one workspace cannot consume the process's whole
 *   stream budget and leave every other workspace unable to open one;
 * - a **per-IP** cap, counted *within* a workspace, so one client can't monopolize
 *   its own workspace's share.
 *
 * This is a concurrency gauge, not a rate limit — it counts connections open
 * RIGHT NOW, so it lives in-process where the socket lifecycle is authoritative
 * (a Redis gauge would leak a slot on every process crash). Presence, which is
 * genuine cross-replica state, stays in Redis; this backstop is deliberately
 * per-process, matching the FD limit it guards. The client's polling fallback
 * keeps low-priority surfaces working when a stream is refused here.
 *
 * ## Why the global cap stays global, and the per-IP cap does not
 *
 * SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §4.2 lists this as a site where "one workspace starves the
 * pod". Both halves of that are true and they want opposite fixes.
 *
 * The **global** number describes the *process* — file descriptors are not
 * partitioned by workspace, and a per-workspace global cap would be a promise the
 * kernel has not made. It is deliberately left shared, and the per-workspace cap
 * below is what stops one workspace reaching it alone.
 *
 * The **per-IP** number describes a *client of a workspace*, and sharing it
 * across workspaces is a real cross-workspace effect with no upside: a NAT'd office
 * whose staff use two Quackback workspaces would have the second workspace's
 * streams refused because of the first's, and a single abusive workspace could
 * deny service to every other workspace behind the same corporate egress IP. So it
 * is counted per (workspace, IP).
