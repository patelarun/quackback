/**
 * Presence under real concurrency.
 *
 * The Redis version's `clearPresence` was an `EVAL` for one reason: Redis is
 * single-threaded, so remove-prune-count-and-drop could not interleave. Ported
 * to Postgres, "it is atomic because it is one statement" is a claim, and a
 * single-threaded test cannot distinguish it from a two-statement version that
 * happens to work when nothing else is running.
 *
 * So every case below runs N real connections against a real server, and each
 * one has a **positive control that fails on the current implementation if the
 * property does not hold** rather than an assertion that a sequential run would
 * also satisfy.
 *
 * The property that matters, stated exactly: across a set of concurrent
 * `clearPresence` calls for one principal, **exactly one** may return true. Two
 * would re-queue an agent's conversations twice; zero would leave them
 * unassigned forever.
