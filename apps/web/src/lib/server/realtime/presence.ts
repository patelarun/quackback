/**
 * Conversation presence, backed by the workspace's Postgres database so it works
 * across replicas (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §7.4).
 *
 * Used to gate offline notifications and offline re-queue: a principal is online
 * while any of their SSE streams is live. Each stream is a row scored by its
 * last heartbeat, so "online" and "last stream closed" are correct across
 * replicas (not just within one process) and self-heal if a replica dies without
 * cleanup — stale rows are excluded by predicate and pruned on the next write.
 *
 * ## What replaced the Lua script
 *
 * Redis held TWO keys: a per-principal sorted set of streams, and a shared
 * `conversation:presence:agents` set. The `EVAL` in the previous version existed
 * to keep them consistent — remove the stream, prune stale members, and drop the
 * principal from the agents set only if nothing remained, with no interleave.
 *
 * There is no second key here. `is_agent` is a column on the stream row, so
 * "which agents are online" is *derived* from the same rows rather than
 * maintained alongside them, and the drift the script prevented is
 * unrepresentable. What still needs atomicity is the decision "was that the last
 * live stream", and `clearPresence` below is a single statement — indivisible
 * for the same reason the Lua script was, and proven under concurrent writers in
 * `__tests__/presence-concurrency.db.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * This is §7.4's second named regression: a write per live stream every 20s,
 * which Redis absorbed for free. It is now ONE statement per heartbeat where
 * Redis issued three commands (ZADD, EXPIRE, ZADD). The measurement is in
 * `lib/server/kv/KV.md`.
 *
 * ## Workspace isolation
 *
 * `listOnlineAgentIds()` feeds conversation routing, so a foreign principal id
 * in its result would assign a conversation to someone who cannot see it. That
 * cannot happen here for two independent reasons: under pooled tenancy the rows
 * live in the workspace's own database, and every statement below additionally
 * filters `workspace_key = currentWorkspaceNamespace()` — the same value that formed
 * the Redis key prefix.

/**
 * Deregister a stream. Returns true when it was the principal's last live stream
 * cluster-wide (they just went offline), so callers can react (e.g. re-queue an
 * agent's unanswered conversations). Stale rows from a crashed replica are
 * pruned first, so a ghost stream cannot keep the principal "online" past the
 * TTL. Returns false on error (don't report a clean offline we couldn't write).
 *
 * ## Why this is a transaction with a lock, and not one clever statement
 *
 * A single statement is atomic, and that is NOT sufficient here — which a
 * single-threaded test cannot tell you, and 24 concurrent teardowns can. The
 * first implementation of this function did the delete and the "is anyone left"
 * check as two CTEs of one statement. Every CTE in a statement shares one
 * snapshot, so with N streams closing at once **every** caller saw the other
 * N−1 rows still present and returned false: `wentOffline` was reported by
 * **zero** of 24, not one. An agent's unanswered conversations would never have
 * been re-queued, silently, and only under load.
 *
 * The fix is the thing Redis was giving away for free: serialization. A
 * transaction-scoped advisory lock keyed on (workspace, principal) makes the
 * concurrent teardowns queue, and because READ COMMITTED takes a **fresh
 * snapshot per statement**, the count that follows the lock sees the
 * predecessors' committed deletes. Exactly one caller finds nothing left.
 *
 * Transaction-scoped (`pg_advisory_xact_lock`) rather than session-scoped, and
 * that distinction is load-bearing on a pooled connection: a session-level
 * advisory lock through a transaction-mode pooler fails open non-deterministically
 * depending on which backend the pooler picks, and survives client disconnect.
 * An xact lock is held by a transaction, which the pooler pins to one backend
 * for its whole life, and is released by COMMIT whatever happens to the client.
 *
 * This is the disconnect path, not the heartbeat path — `writePresent` above is
 * still one statement and takes no lock. Serialization is paid once per stream
 * close, not 3 times a minute per stream.
