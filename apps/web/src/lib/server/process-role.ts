/**
 * Process role — controls whether this instance consumes background queues.
 *
 * QUACKBACK_ROLE=web     Serve HTTP only. Queue modules stay producer-only:
 *                        they can enqueue, but nothing claims a job.
 * QUACKBACK_ROLE=worker  Run the job worker — one poll loop per workspace.
 *                        Still serves HTTP (health probes work unchanged);
 *                        don't route user traffic to it.
 * QUACKBACK_ROLE=all     Both — the default. Unset means `all`, which is the
 *                        self-host single-container path.
 * QUACKBACK_ROLE=migrator Reconcile workspace schemas toward the control plane's
 *                        recorded intent, then exit (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md
 *                        §10.3). Serves no traffic and runs no queues: it holds
 *                        a DIRECT session-mode connection per workspace it is
 *                        working, which is the one thing that must never share
 *                        a process with the serving tier, because holding a
 *                        connection open is exactly what stops a workspace database
 *                        suspending.
 *
 * Read directly from process.env (not the zod config) so the check works in
 * any context without a full config load, mirroring `helpCenterDev`.
 *
 * An unrecognised value fails CLOSED — see `UNRECOGNISED_ROLE_FALLBACK`.
